Plan to have:

- oAuth authentication
- A user friendly, front end design to lets the user enter answers as part of a block of text such as in     (http://www.howmuchareyoupayingyourbroker.com/)
- Start off with three question fields.
- A score generator

Nice to have:

- Google map API that maps out the nearest resources that a user has available to them to help them improve their social mobility score. 

Uh oh:

- If things go bad I can hard code certain for scores for certain user inputs.
- I can create my own mini subset of data if I have trouble pulling in or gathering larger sets of data.
- I can have a google map that has hardcoded markers, maybe I can limit the application to a specific city in order to make it    easier to look for locations/resources.

### [Project Title]

1.) Chance of escaping poverty

If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here

I want to try to make an app where a user goes in and answers a few questions and the site would tell them what their chances of escaping poverty are. After you get your percentage chance of escaping poverty it gives you recomendations on what you can do (mentors, tutors, community outreach etc...)

1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would
you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?

It is an application that is meant to be a bit startling to see how low a person's real chances to escape poverty, and it forces you to visualize a number and mork towards improving that number, maybe gamify your way out of poverty.

5-8 sentences about the application, what it'll do, and why it should exist

People work hard to improve their credit score, why not create a type of social mobility score. The app will generate a score for you and offer you ways of improving your score

2-4 sentences about who would use this application

This application would be used mostly by at risk youth, and people who want to improve their chances of moving up to a different class in society.

It would be cool to make a map of where most people feel happy and find those places where people feel overwhelmingly happy


1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would

A visual way to see the moods of american citizens in real time.

5-8 sentences about the application, what it'll do, and why it should exist

This app is cool because it will allow people to enter their zip code and check thorugh twitter the mood of the people that live around you.
This is a cool idea because, people who are interested in moving to a new place can also see the general mental health of the community they want to move to.

This is basically where I got the idea from: http://users.humboldt.edu/mstephens/hate/hate_map.html#

2-4 sentences about who would use this application
